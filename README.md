## Hi there üëã

# Shan-Chi Wu ‚Äì Statistical Projects & Tools

Welcome! This repository contains selected projects that showcase my research, computational, and educational interests in statistics, data science, and actuarial applications.

## üìò Bookdown

- **[Mastering Statistics with R](https://bookdown.org/Shan_Chi_Wu/MasterStat/)** *(in progress)*  
  An in-progress R book covering core statistical concepts and computational demonstrations using R. Topics include probability, inference, regression, and beyond.

## üì¶ R Packages

- **[RdTranslate](https://github.com/shanchiwu/RdTranslate)**  
  A utility package to translate R documentation files (.Rd) to multiple languages using the OpenAI API. Designed to support non-native English speakers in R development.

- **[distSeqEst](https://github.com/shanchiwu/DistrSeqEst)**  
  Implements distributed sequential estimation procedures for large-scale Data.

## üíª Shiny Apps / Interactive Tools

- **Life Contingency Explorer** *(coming soon)*  
  A shiny app for simulating joint-life annuity risks using copula-based models. Users can customize policyholder age, copula type, and interest rate scenarios.

- **Nelson-Siegel Curve Visualizer** *(coming soon)*  
  An interactive plotly-based tool to visualize yield curves using the Nelson-Siegel model. Users can input curve parameters and view resulting term structures.

- **Initial Margin Calculator** *(coming soon)*  
  Simple interface to compute margin requirements under different financial scenarios.

## üìÑ Conference & Papers

- üó£Ô∏è *‚ÄúProbability of Informed No-Tradings: A Copula-Based PIN Model with Zero-Inflated Poisson Distributions‚Äù* ‚Äì IMT-GT 2024  
  [DOI: 10.1051/itmconf/20246701036](https://doi.org/10.1051/itmconf/20246701036)  
  Developed a clustering structure to evaluate informed trading intensity using zero-inflated Poisson models.
